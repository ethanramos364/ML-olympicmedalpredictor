# Overview
In this project I built a predictive model using python coded in jupyter environment,
to forecast the number of Olympic medals a country would bring home in a given year based on historical data. 
Utilizing a dataset of 2000+ previous olympic results, I trained and fit a model on a comprehensive database containing information about countries, their athletes, and past Olympic performances.
The goal of this model is to predict the number of medals a country is likely to win in future Olympic Games.

# Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared historical data, including country-level performance, athlete statistics, and medal counts. 

Model Training: Utilized pandas, sklearn, numpy, and seaborn tools to train the model, using linear regression to identify trends and relationships within the data.

Prediction: The trained model can predict the number of medals a country might win in future Olympics with fair accuracy. Accuracy increases the more athletes a country has historically sent.

Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated by using simple metrics such as mean error.

# Technologies Used
Python: programming language for data processing and modeling.

Pandas: Used for data manipulation and cleaning.

Scikit-learn: Used for training and evaluating machine learning models.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualization tools for data exploration and model performance.

NumPy: Used for effiecent computation of error ratio, and for cleaning infitite and null values using boolean indexing.
